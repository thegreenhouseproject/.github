Hack Clubbers have a problem: Replit has become too limited on the free plan. Yet it's an amazing tool - club leaders can share a link with their hackers, and everyone instantly gets a development environment set up. To fix this, we're making an open-source web app, free for Hack Clubbers, to make & share games, websites, tools, and more - in a web editor accessible anywhere with an internet connection.

Hack Clubber? Interested teen? Join us in [#greenhouse](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07GRLFC0HM) on the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack), open to all hackers under 18.
